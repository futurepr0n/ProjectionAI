# ProjectionAI

ProjectionAI is a locally run MLB prediction project built around three probability products:

- hitter home run probability
- hitter any-hit probability
- starting pitcher strikeout probability versus the opposing team

The current system uses tabular ensembles for training and a Flask dashboard for exploration, review, and batch export.

## Current Scope

The active code path is:

`data/build_training_dataset.py` -> `models/train_models_v4.py` -> `dashboards/app.py`

Starter strikeouts now have their own dataset and model flow:

`data/build_pitcher_strikeout_dataset.py` -> `models/train_pitcher_strikeout_models.py` -> `dashboards/app.py`

The dashboard supports:

- `HR` predictions
- `Hit` predictions
- `SO` predictions with a slider for `3+`, `4+`, `5+`, and `6+` strikeouts
- per-day team filtering
- optional opponent inclusion for matchup review

## Modeling Summary

### HR / Hit

- built from hitter-game rows in `data/complete_dataset.csv`
- trained with XGBoost + LightGBM + logistic meta model
- evaluated with temporal holdout instead of random final split

### Starter Strikeouts

- built from `daily_lineups`, `games`, `pitching_stats`, `play_by_play_plays`, `play_by_play_pitches`
- one row per starter-game
- supports labels for `3+`, `4+`, `5+`, and `6+` strikeouts
- includes:
  - recent starter form
  - recent opponent team strikeout form
  - starter pitch-mix / arsenal features
  - opponent team performance versus the starter's pitch types
  - recent workload / leash features such as pitch counts and batters faced

## Name Resolution / Data Integration

This project joins multiple baseball data sources that do not always use the same player naming conventions.

Current protections:

- centralized name normalization in `data/name_utils.py`
- audit and review workflow in `data/migrate_player_names.py`
- grouped pending-review exports under `output/`
- team-aware validation and official roster / transaction history support

Important docs:

- [docs/NAME_MATCHING_INVESTIGATION.md](/Users/futurepr0n/Development/Capping.Pro/Github/ProjectionAI/docs/NAME_MATCHING_INVESTIGATION.md)
- [docs/IMPLEMENTATION_BACKLOG.md](/Users/futurepr0n/Development/Capping.Pro/Github/ProjectionAI/docs/IMPLEMENTATION_BACKLOG.md)

## Running Locally

### Environment

This repo is intended to be run locally with the project virtualenv.

```bash
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Start the dashboard

```bash
source venv/bin/activate
python dashboards/app.py
```

Dashboard URL:

`http://127.0.0.1:5002`

### Rebuild datasets

Hitter dataset:

```bash
source venv/bin/activate
python data/build_training_dataset.py
```

Starter strikeout dataset:

```bash
source venv/bin/activate
python data/build_pitcher_strikeout_dataset.py
```

### Train models

HR / Hit ensembles:

```bash
source venv/bin/activate
python models/train_models_v4.py
```

Starter strikeout threshold models:

```bash
source venv/bin/activate
python models/train_pitcher_strikeout_models.py
```

### Generate batch predictions

All targets:

```bash
source venv/bin/activate
python scripts/generate_daily_predictions.py 2025-09-02
```

Starter strikeouts only with threshold selection:

```bash
source venv/bin/activate
python scripts/generate_daily_predictions.py 2025-09-02 --targets so --so-threshold 5
```

## Current Artifacts

Model artifacts are saved under `models/artifacts/`.

Important starter strikeout artifact prefixes:

- `pitcher_so_3_plus`
- `pitcher_so_4_plus`
- `pitcher_so_5_plus`
- `pitcher_so_6_plus`

## Project Notes

- This project is locally run and currently assumes local database access.
- Hardcoded DB credentials are still used in parts of the codebase by design for the current workflow.
- The backlog for active implementation work is tracked in [docs/IMPLEMENTATION_BACKLOG.md](/Users/futurepr0n/Development/Capping.Pro/Github/ProjectionAI/docs/IMPLEMENTATION_BACKLOG.md).
- The repo contains older exploratory scripts and docs; the files listed above reflect the current working path.

## Next Priorities

See [docs/IMPLEMENTATION_BACKLOG.md](/Users/futurepr0n/Development/Capping.Pro/Github/ProjectionAI/docs/IMPLEMENTATION_BACKLOG.md), but the current highest-value open items are:

- prior team-vs-starter / batter-vs-pitcher matchup features with leakage controls
- weather / park / environment improvements
- calibration and betting-oriented backtesting
- reviewed team-mismatch badges in the dashboard
